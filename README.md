## Installation guide

There are 2 ways of installing the plugin to Unreal Engine:

- as a project plugin
- as an engine plugin

In the first case this plugin will be available only in the project where it is installed, in the second - in every project.

### Installing the plugin

This plugin is supplied with source code only, so it should be compiled before using. If you plan to use this plugin as a project plugin and your project is configured as a source project, you can skip this part and just copy it to the `Plugins` folder as described in [this section](##installing-as-project-plugin).

#### Building the plugin

- create a new source project using the engine version you need
- create a `Plugins` directory in the project root directory
- create an `AntilatencySDK` directory in the `Plugins` directory
- copy plugin content to the `AntilatencySDK` directory
- open this project in Unreal Engine

If you are going to use this plugin as a project plugin, you can freely stop here and copy/paste the entire 'AntilatencySDK' directory into the `Plugins` directory of your project.

If you are going to use this plugin as an engine plugin, continue this steps:

- open `Plugins` window using the `Edit/Plugins` menu item
- find and select the Antilatency SDK plugin
- click on the `Package...` link
- select the directory where the compiled plugin will be placed, and press `Select Folder`
- wait for the end of the build progress

Pay attension that if you copy the packaged plugin to the `Plugins` directory of the project, the plugin may be incorrectly packaged with your game because of missing `"EnabledByDefault": false` line in the `AntilatencySDK.uplugin`. This behaviour takes place in Unreal Engine 4.25.x - 4.26.x.

#### Installing as project plugin

Place the plugin to the `<path_to_your_project>/Plugins` directory, so the path to the AntilatencySDK.uplugin will be `<path_to_your_project>/Plugins/AntilatencySDK/AntilatencySDK.uplugin`

#### Installing as engine plugin

Place the packaged plugin to the `<path_to_unreal_engine_istallation_dir>/Engine/Plugins/Runtime` directory, so the path to the AntilatencySDK.uplugin will be `<path_to_unreal_engine_istallation_dir>/Engine/Plugins/Runtime/AntilatencySDK/AntilatencySDK.uplugin`
